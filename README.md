# PancreApp: innovative approach to computational individualization of nutritional therapy in chronic gastrointestinal disorders.

<p>Medical nutrition therapy has a pivotal role in the
management of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, like
chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases
(Leśniowski-Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) or
irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this study is to develop,
deploy and evaluate an interactive application for Windows
and Android operating systems, which could serve as a digital
diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for
the patient and the doctor. The software is gathering details
about patients’ diet and associated fettle in order to estimate
fettle change after future meals, specifically for an individual
patient. In this paper we have described the process of idea
development and application design, feasibility assessment
using a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy
individuals and early results of a clinical trial, which is still
an ongoing study. Results suggest that applied approximative
approach (Shepard’s method of 6-dimensional metric
interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately;
as shown in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).</p>
